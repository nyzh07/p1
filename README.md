# Personal Website

Have you:

- [x] made at least one change to the website to personalize it

GitHub Pages Site link: https://nyzh07.github.io/p1/ 

My custom changes: I changed the site colors, repositioned the profile photo and LinkedIn/Instagram logos, added an image in the "About Me" section, and modified the sizing of elements to better fit my content.
