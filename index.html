                <p>Hello! I am a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park. I came into college studying chemical engineering, 
                    but added a computer science double degree this past summer. I am interested in a career in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology 
                    industry after I graduate. I believe that having programming skills will help me to significantly enhance my efficiency 
                    and productivity. Further, integrating computer science methodologies, like machine learning, can expedite product development processes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of my hobbies is dancing, which I began when I was five years old and hope to continue for as long as possible. 
                    At UMD, I am also heavily involved in Tianyi Dance Team, the university's only traditional Chinese dance group, as an Artistic Board member. 
                    We perform at countless showcases for various organizations on- and off-campus throughout the year, including our own that we hold in the spring. 
                    You can check out our Youtube page <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tianyidance"><i>here</i></a>! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of my other hobbies include exploring nature, learning about skincare, trying 
                    new foods, watching crime shows, and anything arts-and-crafts-related. 
                    I have a six-year-old golden doodle at home named Duke (shown below), who has the best side-eye, is only motivated
                    by food, and is the subject of most of the photos in my camera roll.

                        Conducted a method optimization study to produce higher resolution chromatograms by designing an experiment 
                        with five different gradient programs. Compared the resulting chromatograms of GxP samples to observe the 
                        effect on resolution, and took into consideration the co-elution or merging of impurity peaks. Presented findings to 
                        client, who approved the new gradient to proceed with in upcoming stability and packaging studies.

                        Synthesized nanocomposite thin films using an OT-2 pipetting robot and vacuum filtration. 
                        Evaluated the films' conductive properties by measuring resistance and utilized a Support Vector Machine 
                        (SVM) classifier model to define the design boundaries.
                        Used an active learning loop with three regression models (linear, artifical neural 
                        network, and decision tree) to iteratively and efficiently improve the regression modelsâ€™ 
                        predictive capability. Film strength was characterized by an operated tensile tester after cutting 
                        the films into strips. Accuracy of the models was determined by mean relative error between 
                        the models' prediction of the films' resistance value and the actual value.

                        Adapted five minutes of choreography and developed formations for six students. Created a schedule to ensure ample time delegated towards
                        learning, reviewing, polishing, and defining before early fall performances. 
                        Taught the group over the course of 8 weeks, adjusting for unexpected circumstances to 
                        adhere to the schedule. Led the group for 1-3 hours per week throughout the fall semester. 
                        Contemplated and decided on artistic choices such as costume, lighting, backdrop, hairpiece, makeup, hairstyle, 
                        and more. Improved the cleanliness and emotion of the performance by patiently working with group
                        to correct mistakes, explain feeling, and demonstrate Chinese technique.
